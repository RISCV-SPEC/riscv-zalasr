=== Load Atomic Ordered

Synopsis::
Loads size bytes of memory from the address in _rs1_ atomically and subject to the ordering requirements.

Mnemonic::
lb.{aq,aq.rl} _rd_, (_rs1_)

lh.{aq,aq.rl} _rd_, (_rs1_)

lw.{aq,aq.rl} _rd_, (_rs1_)

ld.{aq,aq.rl} _rd_, (_rs1_)

Description::

This instruction loads size bytes of memory from rs1 atomically.
If the size is less than XLEN, it is sign-extended to fill the destination register.
This load may have ordering annotations _aq_ and _rl_ encoded in the instruction: if the bit _aq_ is set, the instruction has an "acquire-RCsc" annotation, and if the bit _rl_ is set, the instruction has a "release-RCsc" annotation.
If the implementation is not able to complete this load atomically it should generate an address-misaligned or access-fault exception.
The version with only the _rl_ bit set is RESERVED.
RV32 should not implement the d and q variant and RV64 should not implement the q variant.

funct5 for this instruction is 00110.

[NOTE]
====
Load-reserved is not seen as useful at this time, due to its lack of support in language-level memory models.
For maximum compatibility, it is recommended that implementations either support the variant with only _rl_ set or treat it as equivalent to both _aq_ and _rl_ being set.
====
[NOTE]
====
Disassemblers should disassemble the variant with neither _aq_ nor _rl_ set to the plain load instruction.

=== Store Atomic Ordered

Description::

This instruction stores size bytes of memory from rs1 atomically.
This store may have ordering annotations _aq_ and _rl_ encoded in the instruction: if the bit _aq_ is set, the instruction has an "acquire-RCsc" annotation, and if the bit _rl_ is set, the instruction has a "release-RCsc" annotation.
If the implementation is not able to complete this store atomically it should generate an address-misaligned or access-fault exception.
The version with only the _aq_ bit set is RESERVED.
RV32 should not implement the d and q variant and RV64 should not implement the q variant.

funct5 for this instruction is 00111.


[NOTE]
====
Store-acquire is not seen as useful at this time, due to its lack of support in language-level memory models.
For maximum compatibility, it is recommended that implementations either support the variant with only _aq_ set or treat it as equivalent to both _aq_ and _rl_ being set.
====
[NOTE]
====
Disassemblers should disassemble the variant with neither _aq_ nor _rl_ set to the plain store instruction.
